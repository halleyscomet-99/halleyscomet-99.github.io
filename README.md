## Overview

This website serves as a centralized hub for my engineering projects, academic research, and creative endeavors. It is built with a focus on clean typography, smooth motion design, and a highly organized data-driven architecture.

## Credits & Reference

This portfolio is built upon the foundational framework provided by [Utkarsh Singhal](https://github.com/Utkarsh-Singhal-26/portfolio). 

I have customized the UI, added new functional modules (Publications, Education, Search functionality), and integrated my own data structures. Massive thanks to the original author for the open-source contribution!
