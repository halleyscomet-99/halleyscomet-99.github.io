My passion lies in creating robust, life-enhancing robotics that solve tangible problems while maintaining a playful, artistic edge. I believe that the future of technology should be as much about soul and aesthetics as it is about sensors and code, and I am committed to developing reliable platforms that make a more beautiful, functional world possible.","EXPERTISE":"My expertise spans the full robotics stack, from designing custom embedded electronics and mechanical structures to implementing robust perception and motion planning pipelines. Beyond the lab, I also create indie games and write music as a singer-songwriter."}}],"$L5"]}]]}],"$L6"],["$L7","$L8","$L9"],"$La"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
